CREATE TABLE CountryDetails (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    countryname VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    capitalcity VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);


INSERT INTO CountryDetails (countryname, capitalcity)
VALUES
('India', 'New Delhi'),
('USA', 'Washington, D.C.'),
('France', 'Paris'),
('India', 'New Delhi'),         -- Duplicate
('Germany', 'Berlin'),
('Japan', 'Tokyo'),
('France', 'Paris'),            -- Duplicate
('Australia', 'Canberra'),
('India', 'New Delhi');         -- Duplicate

Method 1: using DELETE statement
  
delete c1 
from cd c1
join cd c2
on c1.countryname = c2.capitalcity
and c1.capitalcity = c2.capitalcity
where c1.id > c2.id;

Method 2: add unique or DISTINCT records

CREATE TABLE new_cd AS
SELECT MIN(id) AS id, countryname, capitalcity
FROM cd
GROUP BY countryname, capitalcity;

select * from new_cd;

Once you have populated the new table, you can delete the old table and rename the new table to the old table, as shown below. 
The syntax may look different if you use different databases.

Method 3: using ROW_NUMBER() function

  WITH cte AS (
    SELECT id, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY countryname, capitalcity ORDER BY id) AS row_no
    FROM cd
)
DELETE FROM cd
WHERE id IN (
    SELECT id FROM cte WHERE row_no > 1
);

select * from cd;
